# Trailing period
Except free users, all users will have 7 days free trial period. After the trial period, the user have to pay to get the store active. If the user does not pay, the store will be deactivated util the payment is made. The user will be notified by email, notification, and in-app notification.

# When to get paid

Payment is based on the number of members and subscription of each store. The payment is made at the end of each month by the store owner for specific store at once.

If a member is removed before end of month, the user will be charged as per hour. The remaining balance will be refunded to the store balance.


# Monthly price to hours converter
To convert a server price from per month to per hour, you need to divide the monthly cost by the number of hours in a month.

The formula is: Hourly Cost = Monthly Cost / (730 hours)

The reason why we use 730 hours instead of 720 is that there are typically 30.4167 days in a month on average (365 days per year / 12 months). Multiplying that value by 24 hours per day gives us 730 total hours per month.

For example, if the server cost is $1000 per month, then: Hourly Cost = $1000 / 730 hours Hourly Cost = $1.37 per hour

Thus, the server cost is approximately $1.37 per hour.

# Enterprise
